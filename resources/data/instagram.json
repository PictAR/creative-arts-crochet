We recently bought a little cottage that we’re renovating and I keep dreaming of making vintage inspired throws and pillows. This pattern book was published in 1979 and has the exact patterns I was wishing to recreate. Such a cool find! 😍😍😍\n\n#thrifting #crochet #crochetersofinstagram #crochetaddict #vintagestyle #crochetafghan",

    "caption": "Meet the Maker! This is long overdue!!! I’ve been especially quiet designing my first pattern in the background so thank you for your patience with my lack of posts lately.\n\nMy name is Amanda Arts and I’m a self-taught crocheter who learned off a Reader’s Digest Magazine over 10 years ago. It wasn’t a skill I kept up with and it was basically dormant until I became an Aunt. I wanted a crazy Aunt skill to haunt these children with for their entire lives; imagining ugly sweaters, hats, scarfs, blankets and things I could make them. 🤪 Our family has welcomed three babies who received a classic granny square blanket and a hat or two until COVID became part of our regular vocabulary.\n\nWhen the first lockdown was issued, I decided to challenge myself and crochet a sweater, calling it my “COVID cardigan”. I thought by the time COVID was over I would have a sweater to brag about. I made that sweater and another and another and another….. Obviously we’re all well aware that it still hasn’t ended and I’ve basically created a wardrobe since then.\n\nI have a day job that involves a significant amount of data analysis so having a creative outlet is super important to me. As I’ve been designing, my day job has provided a significant amount of transferable skills which has allowed me to essentially act as my own tech editor. 🤞🤞🤞 In a week or two I’ll be ready for a testing call which I’m really looking forward to.\n\nSo that’s me in a nutshell about how I started crocheting. I’ll share more as I lead up to introducing some of my own work. Thanks for reading and being part of my journey! ❤️❤️❤️\n\n#creativeartscrochet #crochet #croche #croché #crochê #crochetaddict #crochetersofinstagram #makersgonnamake #makers #handmade #imadethis #makersofinstagram #whatsonmyhook #goals #crafty",

The pattern design is by @outstandingcrochet who I’m a crochet super-fan of. The level of detail Natalia provides in her patterns is unreal! I fully credit her designs for giving me the confidence needed to get from beginner level into the realm of advanced and intermediate work. ❤️\n\n#creativeartscrochet #crochet #croche #croché #crochê #crochetaddict #crochetersofinstagram #makersgonnamake #makers #handmade #imadethis #makersofinstagram #whatsonmyhook #goals #crafty",
